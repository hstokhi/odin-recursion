# odin-recursion

Repository built to practice recursive algorithms. Part of The Odin Project Curriculum. 
In this project, I completed two assignments. First, both iteratively and recursively,
I created an n-length array with numbers in Fibonacci's Sequence. Second, I implemented
a mergeSort algorithm to sort a list of integers.
